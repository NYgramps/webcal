When viewed in a browser, **webcal.html** displays an annual calandar for the year interactively input by the user; the current day of the current year is highlighted.
Because it is a static file, it can be bookmarked in the browser for quick reference.
Note that it does not provide an addressbook or appointments, but does work offline and
is supported by plain vanilla *javascript* and *css*.
